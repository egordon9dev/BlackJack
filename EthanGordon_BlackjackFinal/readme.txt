how to run:
	- this is a netbeans project folder but you can turn it into whatever you like
	- the main runner is called GameGUI.java

how to play:
	- set number of players
	- hit [PLAY]
	- set money and hit [ENTER] (or click another textfield)
	- repeat for all money textfields
	- set each bet the same way as wen you set the money
	- now cards should pop up
	- if the dealer's up card is an ace set an insurance bet ***before you do
	anything else***
	- play the round
	- once everyone is done press again to start a new round
	- repeat

	note: if the game becomes unresponsive you may have to restart. It occassionally freezes, but not often. If it seems frozen it is probably due to forgetting to set the money, bet, or insurance bet because the gui will wait at these points
